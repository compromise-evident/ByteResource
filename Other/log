RawVisual log



Version 6.0.0   Extraction mode! Retrieve original / partial file, directly from
                a -VISUAL.txt file. So you can share any file as  plaintext just
                by letting RawVisual create the analysis txt file. Now checks if
                path_to_file is bash-compliant so if bad characters are present,
                system calls to hash are not made so you won't see errors.

Version 5.0.0   Analyzed written to file only. Output dir: attempts dir of given
                file and if not allowed then writes analysis file to default dir
                (working dir.)Added "bytes_to_skip" so Bytes can be skipped, and
                "bytes_to_see" so only that  quantity  will be analyzed & saved.
                User may enter ridiculous values, there are catch-alls for that.
                Minimalist, simpler. These features  alone  allow you to see all
                Bytes, single Bytes, and intervals.  Added + edited ref in .cpp.

                sha256sum, and sha512sum.

Version 3.0.0   Loops your entry of: how many file Bytes to display, and whether
                you want to display them as int or actual, omitting non-standard
                since Android terminal corrups from special char even with sane.
