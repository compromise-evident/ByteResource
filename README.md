### ByteVisual.cpp is my most-referenced file when building a tool, so should it be yours.

So what can it do? Many things if you apply reasoning and logical deduction, scroll through it. Try creating a text file on Windows, paste it on pastebin.pl, and download the paste. You'll notice the files are different sizes (yes, ctrl+c will pick up \r\n as intended.) Now let ByteVisual take a look. You'll see that pastebin.pl had stripped away 1 Byte for every "enter" in the file. Try it and see which Byte it is, then read about them in ByteVisual.cpp. You'll learn about the \r\n fuckery of copy/paste, how to deal with each byte like an integer then revert, how to use Bash in C++, data types without unspecified behavior, how to properly use gparted, and how to tell if your files have hidden characters.

```text
cout << char(195) << char(191);
```
prints only the one char Ã¿ to the terminal. It's 2 Bytes long.
